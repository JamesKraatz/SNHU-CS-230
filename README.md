•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, “The Gaming Room,” currently provides a game application they want to expand from being an Android application to being a web-based application capable of running on Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile platforms. The client does not have experience with web-based or distributed application development is asking that we recommend and develop their system.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I identified physical limitations and system constraints as applied to various platforms as related to the customer’s software requirements.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The more information and understanding I have of the customer’s software need and the greater my knowledge and experience with the considered platforms.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to review the multi-platform tools and implementation. I would like to put together a proof of concept or minor demonstration application and test it on the different platforms. Then adjust my recommendations accordingly.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to personalize the user’s experience and consider what hardware and performance requirements would be present in their system. Then tailor the solution to provide a satisfactory or better performance withing those hardware confinements. The user perspective is important because it is the user that is using the application. If the application does not meet the user’s needs, then the user will not use the application. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Historically I have focused on breaking up a prospective application into sections or functional groups. After this was done, I would then compare groups for similarities and points to divide again, repeating this until I had a mental picture of the whole app, its sub-sections, and groups, and how the pieces interact in mind. Then, I would begin to code, pseudocode, or flow chart the different areas depending on their complexity. Repeating this along with compiling, testing, and recompiling as I built the code in to the actual application. In the future, it seems better to start off a little similar but with a focus on how the application would fit in one or several established patterns. This requires me to understand the patterns and be able to apply them when appropriate, but it should simplify and quicken the code development, increase its understandability, maintainability, reliability, and reuse.
